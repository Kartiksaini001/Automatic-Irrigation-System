# Automatic Irrigation System
This repository contains the code and ppt documentation of my project Automatic Irrigation System.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to design a system that automatically supplies the water to plants/crops and maintains the moisture level of the soil.

### Solution:
* I used Arduino UNO and soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level of the soil and supply water according to the requirements.
* Two code files are available in this repository
    * `digital_code.ino`: In this, the sensor is connected to digital pins of Arduino and the threshold to trigger the moisture sensor cannot be changed in the code.
    * `analog_code.ino`: In this, the sensor is connected to analog pins of Arduino and we can adjust the threshold in the code.
* The detailed explanation is available in the `Automatic Irrigation.pptx` file.
